# CS458 Project 2

## Introduction
In this project, we implemented a mobile-native COVID-19 vaccine survey page, and then tested it using Appium.

## Directory Structure
There are two different folders. SurveyApp folder contains the source code for the front end of the project written using React Native. SurveyTesting folder contains our Appium testing code written in Java. Each folder contains a README file with the build instructions.
